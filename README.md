# DropzZ-Cleaner
This tool cleans your PC and makes it faster.

Is your PC slow and you want it to be fast and tidy again? This code will help you clean and organize your system. But what can this code do? Let's go through each point:

**Explorer:**
Restarts your Windows Explorer. Only use if you have problems with it.

**Winget:**
The Winget function can only be used by those of you who have Windows 11 on your PC. It ensures that all programs for which you have purchased an official license are automatically updated. This includes programs like Epic, Discord, and more.

**Health:**
The Health function checks your PC for broken files. It ensures that all Windows folders are scanned and any issues that arise are fixed.

**Scan:**
Similar to the Health function, the Scan function searches for corrupted Windows files, finds them, and repairs them for you.

**Temp:**
The Temp function clears all the temp paths in Windows, freeing up more space on your PC and making applications run smoothly again.

**Optimize:**
The Optimize function scans, defragments, and optimizes all the drives you have installed. This should be done every two weeks to achieve the best possible performance and efficiency of your drives.

**Restart:**
If you've completed all the steps, press the button to restart your system.
